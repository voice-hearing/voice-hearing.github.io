      <link>http://localhost:1313/what-we-do/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/what-we-do/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-us--azumi-trust&#34;&gt;About Us ‚Äî Azumi Trust&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhere the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî 2 Corinthians 3:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture yourself stepping into a space where &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt; bloom in the heart of South-East Birmingham. Here, at Azumi Trust, our name‚Äî&lt;em&gt;Azumi&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîrings rich with meaning. Rooted in the Persian word for ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù or ‚Äúliberty,‚Äù it travels through diverse Middle Eastern and South Asian languages‚ÄîLuri, Pashto, Kurdish, Hindko, Baluchi, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Kashmiri‚Äîcarrying the promise of liberty to all corners of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you sense that gift, imagine how that freedom isn‚Äôt just a word here; it is lived in every handshake, every conversation, every moment of care extended across cultures, ages, and faiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-story-and-mission-following-the-spirit&#34;&gt;Our Story and Mission: Following the Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in &lt;strong&gt;1991&lt;/strong&gt; by Dr. Robin Fisher, a compassionate GP who witnessed deep hardship in Sparkbrook‚Äôs drug-affected community, Azumi Trust has grown from a humble outreach into a vibrant Christian charity. Though the original medical practice and drug treatment closed mid-1990s, our vision‚Äî&lt;em&gt;to follow where God is working&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîendures and expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might hear echoes of the past as youth clubs once filled Azumi House‚Äôs rooms with laughter and learning; see children kicking balls with the Azumi Tigers football team; or feel the gentle warmth of mothers gathering in groups that blossom into friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trust doesn‚Äôt seek to create projects on its own; instead, it accompanies passionate community members and seasoned Christian workers who simply want to &lt;em&gt;get on with&lt;/em&gt; serving, unburdened by red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;azumi-house--a-home-a-haven&#34;&gt;Azumi House ‚Äî A Home, A Haven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-full&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Azumi-house.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Azumi House&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step closer to &lt;strong&gt;Azumi House&lt;/strong&gt;, the heart of our operations and a symbol of transformation. Once a family home, then a GP surgery, Azumi House has been a sanctuary since our purchase in &lt;strong&gt;1997&lt;/strong&gt; with support from Christ Church Sparkbrook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the walls that have housed over two dozen men across more than a dozen nationalities‚Äîyoung, single Christians who find refuge here. Imagine the reflections in the large ground floor rooms that once echoed with youth club chatter, now transformed into welcoming residential spaces, while ‚ÄúThe Workshop‚Äù remains alive as a place for prayer and intimate community meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building is more than bricks; it‚Äôs a living story, a &lt;em&gt;vehicle&lt;/em&gt; inviting others onboard to journey together in hope, sharing experiences and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi House stands as a cornerstone of Azumi Trust‚Äôs mission, embodying a rich history of transformation and community support in South-East Birmingham. Originally a family home turned GP surgery in the 1980s, it became central to the Trust‚Äôs work when Dr. Robin Fisher, the founder of Azumi Trust, took over the practice. In 1997, with the help of Christ Church Sparkbrook and a major donor, the Trust purchased the building, marking a new chapter of dedicated service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine Azumi House as more than just a building‚Äîit&amp;rsquo;s a sanctuary of hope and healing. Over the years, it has provided a safe, low-rent home primarily for disadvantaged Christian single men, often young, from more than a dozen nationalities. The first floor has long been home to these men, reflecting the Trust‚Äôs commitment to creating a community where residents are supported pastorally and encouraged to grow in faith and independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground floor has witnessed decades of vibrant community activity. It once housed a youth club and homework club aimed at local children and young people, mainly run by members of Christ Church but open to all in the neighborhood. It has been a base for various projects like the ‚ÄòBright Sparks‚Äô mother and toddler group and even the ‚ÄòAzumi Tigers‚Äô football team. The Trust‚Äôs ethos has always been to ‚Äúfollow what God is doing,‚Äù supporting existing passionate community efforts rather than setting up new structures unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the Trust renovated an annex known as ‚ÄòThe Workshop,‚Äô providing an additional meeting space with separate access and facilities. This room continues today as a prayer room and a place for small community gatherings. Although the two large ground floor rooms were eventually converted for residential use following the opening of the new Christ Church building nearby in 2012, the Workshop remains a beacon of outreach and spiritual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi House also offers guest accommodations upstairs, welcoming visitors of residents and short-term guests, reinforcing the sense of community and hospitality at the heart of the Trust‚Äôs vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you imagine the walls of Azumi House, envision a place alive with stories of restoration‚Äîa place where freedom, peace, and new life blossom in alignment with the Trust‚Äôs strapline from 2 Corinthians 3:17: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhere the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; The building acts as both a physical and spiritual ‚Äòvehicle,‚Äô enabling various groups and individuals to journey together, share resources, and deepen their impact in South-East Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This living space continues to evolve, with a renewed focus on building a mutually supportive Christian community while serving and welcoming the broader local area. Azumi House remains a tangible expression of Azumi Trust‚Äôs mission‚Äîoffering shelter, support, and a faithful presence amid one of the UK‚Äôs most diverse and dynamic urban neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you picture yourself walking through its doors, you‚Äôd encounter not only a safe home but a community where hope flourishes, friendships are formed, and lives are quietly transformed by genuine care and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine the gentle hands tending rows of vegetables, the soft rustle of leaves in a garden born out of compassion. The &lt;strong&gt;Hope Therapeutic Garden&lt;/strong&gt;, started in &lt;strong&gt;2008&lt;/strong&gt;, offers more than green growth‚Äîit nurtures healing, friendship, and belonging for those marginalized by ethnicity, disability, or status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualize people arriving with anticipation, perhaps singing joyous songs like &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm on Top Of The World‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;, stepping off their buses, ready to embrace the peace found in soil and fellowship. Feel the comforting aroma of earth mingling with warm cups of tea shared beneath open skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over twelve years, retreats into the Cotswolds or camping trips challenged by British weather have woven stories of resilience and joy. Annual BBQs and celebrations mark community milestones, birthdays, and global traditions‚Äîeach event strengthening bonds and echoing the love of Christ in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants learn new skills‚Äîcomposting, grafting, growing exotic crops‚Äîand form friendships that become lifelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Therapeutic Garden, also lovingly known as Hope Garden, is a verdant sanctuary of healing, fellowship, and renewal deeply rooted in the heart of South-East Birmingham. Born in 2008 from a compassionate vision sparked by Mary Carroll, who after witnessing the struggles of destitute asylum seekers living nearby, sought to create a place where marginalized individuals‚Äîespecially women suffering from social exclusion, poor mental health, and other challenges‚Äîcould find rest, support, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a wild, uncared-for garden transformed by gentle hands into an inviting space where people of many backgrounds gather over tea and conversation, healing through connection and the nurturing power of nature. Mary saw growing and harvesting not only as practical acts but as profound healing practices‚Äîmoments where people relax, share stories, and experience Christ‚Äôs love in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden became a refuge from harsh realities‚Äîwhere participants could thrive emotionally, mentally, and socially. The early attendees were residents of nearby Hope House and visitors from health drop-in sessions at Azumi House. For many, the garden offered better nourishment than medicine‚Äîboth physical from the fresh produce grown and mental from the community‚Äôs support. One participant even celebrated arriving at Hope Garden by singing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on Top of the World,‚Äù a joyful expression of the freedom and happiness the garden inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Garden also nurtured growth beyond plants: retreats to serene locations like the Cotswolds, Belmont Abbey, and British parks enriched participants‚Äô spirits. Annual gatherings, like summer BBQs and celebrations of cultural days such as World Africa Day, Easter egg hunts, and Christmas festivities, knit diverse individuals into a warm, extended family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers play a vital role here‚Äîfaithful people like Nathalie, Mauricio, and Pauline who go the extra mile, whether by driving participants to events, delivering food, offering advice, or simply being dependable friends. Despite challenges like funding shortages or unexpected hurdles (heating failures, last-minute meal preparations), the faith and dedication of this small but mighty team keep the garden flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Hope Garden, people learn valuable skills such as composting, grafting, and vegetable cultivation. The project also forged connections with organizations like Ryton Organic Gardens through initiatives like ‚ÄúGrowing From Your Roots,‚Äù which celebrate heritage, gardening traditions, and cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you envision Hope Therapeutic Garden, feel the gentle rustle of leaves and the quiet hum of friendship growing alongside vegetables. Hear laughter blending with bird song. See faces brightened by shared meals and nature‚Äôs beauty. Know that here, in this vibrant patch of earth, freedom, peace, and new life take root‚Äîoffering hope not just as a word, but as a lived reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Garden stands as a testament to Azumi Trust‚Äôs spirit: to &lt;em&gt;follow where God is working&lt;/em&gt;, to foster belonging among the marginalized, and to share love that transforms both the soil and the soul. It invites all who enter to be part of a growing story‚Äîone of nurture, healing, and joyful life renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;volunteers-and-trustees--the-heartbeat-of-our-work&#34;&gt;Volunteers and Trustees ‚Äî The Heartbeat of Our Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind every garden bloom and every sunset over Azumi House stand &lt;strong&gt;volunteers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;trustees&lt;/strong&gt;. Picture Nathalie and Mauricio, Columban missionaries pressing beyond their comfort zones to serve, or Pauline driving the minibus, delivering life-saving support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel the warmth radiating from their honest dedication‚Äîthe countless acts of kindness like delivering meals, guiding those lost through paperwork, and holding hands during hard times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trustees, Liz, Mike, and Eve, quietly navigate challenges‚Äîconflict resolution, sourcing resources, stewarding finances‚Äîensuring the Trust‚Äôs foundation remains strong and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future plans include expanding garden spaces, offering more supported accommodation, deepening interfaith dialogue, and partnering with grassroots projects who share our Christian ethos but seek a stable structure to amplify their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each initiative, every new smile formed in the light of faith and care, is a testimony that the Spirit‚Äôs work here is alive and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî Mahatma Gandhi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhere the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî 2 Corinthians 3:17&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúLove cannot remain by itself ‚Äî it has no meaning. Love has to be put into action and that action is service.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî Mother Teresa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi Trust is not just a charity‚Äîit is a &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; of freedom, faith, and fellowship, quietly changing lives in South-East Birmingham and inviting you to join the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine&lt;/em&gt; your story intertwining here‚Äîand feel how giving, serving, and belonging bring freedom not only to others but within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-purpose-of-azumi-trust&#34;&gt;The Purpose of Azumi Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi Trust stands as a beacon of hope and transformation in South-East Birmingham, deeply rooted in a Christian mission to bring freedom, peace, and new life to marginalized individuals and families. For over three decades, this charitable organization has tirelessly worked to nurture a community where love is not just felt but lived, reflecting the profound truth that *‚ÄúLove cannot remain by itself ‚Äî it has no meaning. Love has to be put into action and that action is service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its heart, Azumi Trust exists to serve those often overlooked‚Äîpeople affected by age, ethnicity, disability, poverty, or displacement‚Äîoffering not only practical assistance but a compassionate, faith-filled community. Inspired by the life and teachings of Christ, the Trust‚Äôs purpose is far-reaching yet deeply personal: to foster belonging, well-being, and spiritual growth in neighborhoods where these gifts are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mahatma Gandhi wisely said, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Azumi Trust exemplifies this by placing service at the center of its work, creating spaces where lives can be rebuilt, relationships restored, and hope renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-activities-of-azumi-trust&#34;&gt;Main Activities of Azumi Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;azumi-house-a-safe-haven&#34;&gt;Azumi House: A Safe Haven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Trust‚Äôs flagship initiatives is &lt;strong&gt;Azumi House&lt;/strong&gt;, providing secure, low-rent accommodation for disadvantaged Christian single men, particularly in the Sparkbrook area. This project offers more than shelter‚Äîit is a place of refuge, pastoral care, and community engagement, enabling residents to regain stability and actively participate in local church life and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;active-community-projects&#34;&gt;Active Community Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi Trust supports three vibrant community projects that directly benefit local families and individuals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope Garden Project:&lt;/strong&gt; A sanctuary for asylum seekers and refugees where healing flourishes through gardening skills, fellowship, and mutual support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladies‚Äô Day:&lt;/strong&gt; Weekly gatherings that nurture fellowship and encouragement among local women, strengthening bonds of sisterhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children‚Äôs Club:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing a safe, joyful space for children to learn, play, and grow in a supportive environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these projects embody the belief that &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúSmall acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interfaith-bridge-building&#34;&gt;Interfaith Bridge Building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living their Christian faith with humility and openness, Azumi Trust fosters respectful dialogue and cooperation among people of different faiths. By sharing Christ‚Äôs love with sensitivity to diversity, the Trust creates opportunities for deeper community connection and mutual growth‚Äîinviting all to experience the &lt;em&gt;well-being&lt;/em&gt; that comes from peace and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;collaborative-ministry-and-outreach&#34;&gt;Collaborative Ministry and Outreach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi Trust also acts as an umbrella organization, partnering with like-minded Christian groups to provide governance, financial support, and facilities, ensuring that grassroots projects can thrive without bureaucratic burdens. Their outreach and pastoral care programs impact hundreds of lives annually‚Äîoffering advocacy, support, and new opportunities for those in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-spirit-of-freedom-peace-and-hope&#34;&gt;A Spirit of Freedom, Peace, and Hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trust‚Äôs name, &lt;em&gt;Azumi&lt;/em&gt;, means freedom‚Äîan ethos reflected in every facet of their work. As Malcolm X observed, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Through compassionate service, Azumi Trust helps individuals reclaim this freedom, fostering peace not only in external circumstances but within hearts and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-reflection&#34;&gt;Closing Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azumi Trust‚Äôs mission reminds us that &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Their unwavering commitment to serving Birmingham‚Äôs diverse communities, one life at a time, eloquently illustrates how faith in action multiplies hope beyond measure‚Äîchanging lives and transforming selves alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To support or learn more about Azumi Trust‚Äôs inspiring work is to step into a story of love, freedom, and flourishing community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
