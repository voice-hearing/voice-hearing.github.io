# **About Us - Asumen charity** 
        
*“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”* — 2 Corinthians 3:17  

Asumen charity is a small but deeply rooted Christian charity serving **west london** — a place where diverse cultures meet, and where the need for freedom, peace, and new life is as real as the air we breathe.  

The name **Asumen** comes from the Persian word for *“freedom” or “liberty”*, a word sung in multiple languages — Luri, Pashto, Kurdish, Hindko, Baluchi, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Kashmiri. *From its sound alone, you might begin to feel the heartbeat of our mission — to bring freedom to those weighed down, peace to those in turmoil, and new life to all, through the love of Jesus Christ.*

## **Our Story: Following God’s Lead**
        
It began in 1983** with Dr. Robin jeremiah, a GP in london, moved by compassion for the many drug users in his community.  
From a small Christian outreach grew a vision — a vision we still carry today: *follow what God is doing* rather than impose our own plans.  
        
In the mid-1990s, when the initial medical and drug work ended, the charity’s heartbeat continued. By **1997**, with the support of Christ Church, the old GP surgery became **Asumen House** — our home, our base, and a place of transformation.
        
In those early days, you could hear the *laughter of youth clubs*, the *soft chatter of homework help sessions*, and the *warm welcome of community mothers and toddlers*. Later came football teams like *Asumen Tigers*, and projects like *Bright Sparks*.

## **Volunteers and charityees: The Heart and the Hands**
        
Every day, our **volunteers** bring this mission to life — some offering listening ears, some practical skills, others a strong back or creative spark. Our **charityees** guide the journey, ensuring every choice honours the founding vision while embracing today’s opportunities.
        
*As you picture their dedication, you might begin to notice how your own skills, prayers, or time could weave into this same fabric of care.*

## **Buildings That Shelter Dreams**
        
**Asumen House** is more than a building. It’s a home for projects like the **Hope Garden** — where people find healing through soil and friendship, or as a quiet meeting space for grassroots Christian initiatives.  
        
We like to see ourselves as a **vehicle** — one you can step aboard for as long as you need. We provide the structure, governance, insurance, funding support, and network… you just bring your God-given vision, and together, we travel further.

## **Future Projects: The Road Ahead**
        
In **2010**, we became a Charitable Company with a new constitution to welcome fresh partnerships — and we’re not stopping here.  
        
We envision:
- More safe meeting spaces.
- Expanded community garden projects.  
- Greater interfaith bridge-building.  
- Support for more groups who already have the *passion* to serve but need the *framework* to flourish.  
        
*Perhaps right now, you can already imagine the lives waiting to be touched… the doors waiting to open.*
